# Phenotype RAG
This project **biophenotype-rag** implements a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application to answer questions about phenotypes using biological and genomic data. The pipeline integrates information retrieval with response generation via language models (LLM), facilitating accurate analysis of phenotypic data.
